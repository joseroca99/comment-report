Great phone. Face recognition doesn‚Äôt work.,"Bought this for my daughter. She worked all year having good grades. You get what you pay for.I got the IPHONE XR 256gb (red) Everything is fine.

But for a 6th grader it‚Äôs an iPhone that‚Äôs all they worry about. Trying to get another phone. And I‚Äôll be giving her my phone.Now I‚Äôve bought my XR (blue) from them before.

Phone volume too low,Only complaint about my refurbished Iphone X was the phone volume for calls is very low to hear the other person so I had to resort to speaker or wireless earbuds.

"Already connected to another Verizon account, un-useable & return process was frustrating","Product was beautiful and in great physical & operating condition. Spent a lot of time setting it up but once I took it to the Verizon store to be connected to my account they told me it was already registered under another Verizon account and could there for never be used by another Verizon account.  I requested a replacement through the same retailer who suggested they could have it delivered within a week. The estimated delivery was ultimately extended by another week until it was canceled all together by the retailer without notifying me. Bummer bc last time I bought the exact same phone from the exact same retailer (this time around I'd literally just gone into my old orders and clicked to ""buy again""), and it went off without a hitch.",

Save your money and buy elsewhere,When I received the phone it had a few dings and dents. Fine with me as it wasn‚Äôt to be a daily driver or anything special but the most irritating thing was the promise of 90% or better battery life all but guaranteed by Amazon itself. This phone arrived at 87%. I called and was given some money off which I never saw. I had to sell the phone 3rd party at a loss to make SOME of my money back. This was the 2nd iPhone I bought and had issues with. The XS max I bought before it ended up overheating so bad it wasn‚Äôt safe to handle when charging. The iPhone 12 I‚Äôm currently typing on however showed up with 1 tiny scratch and 100% battery life so I‚Äôm thinking I got lucky on that one. Needless to say I‚Äôm not overly thrilled with Amazons false guarantees of quality or the ‚Äúdiscount‚Äù I supposedly got but in reality never did. Luck of the draw I suppose.,

¬†I decided to buy the iPhone XR from HybridIT, not only was it delivered within 2 days but it has a 99% battery, there‚Äôs not even a scratch on the screen. The only wear is a slight mark on the back of the phone that‚Äôs going to be covered by a case anyways. Absolutely so happy, I recommend making sure you buy from HybridIT because this is my second purchase of a different phone and it went above excellent condition in my opinion!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Shakey Screen,"We had the phone about 3 days and the screen started shaking and wouldn't let select any of the apps.  Not sure if this phone was ""reconditioned"" properly..",
Really good!,Bottom of screen glitches sometimes. Battery life is so shortü•≤,
Screen went bad in 89 days. Hours on phone chat trying to resolve,"The screen started jumping on day 89. Contacted amazon as renewed warranty is 90 days. Had to watch 2 YouTube videos and try lots of steps, then after 2 hours they suggested I pay 75.00 to download another troubleshooting app which I refused. Then amazon said I had to contact 3rd party seller as they only warranty for 30 days. My last ‚ÄúRenewed‚Äù purchase",
Great value for intermediate tech users.,My dad is not a techie and does not take professional photos. So this alternative to get him a newer iPhone than what he had with a larger screen and a jump to face recognition at this price‚Ä¶ great deal. Plus with 128gb he‚Äôll never have to delete grandkid‚Äôs pics again because of lack of space.,5.0 out of 5 stars

iPhone Xr -Piece of crap,"The refurbished phones from Amazon are pieces of crap, they don't seem to work more than a few weeks and then they fail. I have gone through two refurbished phones, both never lasted more than a week or two. Why Amazon puts up with this crap I'll never know. IN MY OPINION, you sell it, you are responsible for the product. Instead, Amazon quickly passes it off to third party responsibility, passing you off to third party people that don't live by Amazon standards. Slick avoidance if you ask me.",5.0 out of 5 stars
It‚Äôs what I expected for a renewed phone,Phone came as expected. Few little scratches but nothing major. Battery life is like a new phone.,5.0 out of 5 stars
CHECK THE PHONE THOROUGHLY BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,"The cellular telephone came as promised. It looked good, no scratches, no chips, no dings. Battery was almost empty. Charged it up and turned the phone off. When I went to put the screen protector and case on the telephone I noticed that the phone's screen was blank (black) but there were sounds as though the phone was working.As you can guess, the phone is on it's way back to Amazon and I'll see how this return and refund goes.",
"Fragile piece of crap, but great battery","Of course it still has glass all the way up to the edge, completely unprotected. So it will break very easily even with a case on it. The battery is great. The face id is not. Losing the home button makes everything frustrating and harder to use. There ends up being too many fine little motions you have to learn in order just to get to the screen you want.",
Everything‚Äôs ok except the speaker.,The phones speaker on phone calls doesn‚Äôt work very well. All the sounds are muffled.,

Exactly As Described,"I was looking for the best value per dollar when I ordered a new to me phone. Shipping was quick, and tracking was spot on. Once device arrived company had included an easy to follow ‚Äúhow to‚Äù to set up device. The body of the phone had slight wear on top and bottom which appears to be from its previous case.

Broken,"Had phone activated for my daughter and the volume button doesn‚Äôt work - can only turn the phone up, not down; and the power button doesn‚Äôt work unless you press it towards the top of the button. When I went to exchange the phone for a different one,  it wasn‚Äôt an option I‚Äôm guessing because the price has gone up $20. That shouldn‚Äôt matter since I ordered a working phone at the original price. Not a satisfied customer.",

Broken phone arrived,I was under the impression that these items were tested before they were sent out. Obviously not the case because I received a phone that I can't even hear people talking.  Let's hope the replacement phone works,
iPhone purchase,Do NOT buy from this company. This phone was a piece of Junk. Barely had for 6 Mo. and my phones Wi-Fi chip melted and could not be repaired. This company is very UNsupportive. What a waste of hard earned money. This company could care less about that.,
Bad speaker,"Can‚Äôt hear out of the speaker and they want me to send it back and wait till they receive it to send another one, guess I‚Äôll have to pay out of pocket to fix this one because it will take too long if I send it back, just won‚Äôt buy anything like this from here agin",

¬†I purchased a renewed iPhone XR in excellent condition and it is indeed in excellent condition.  The phone did not have one scratch or ding or dent.  I called my mom and she could hear me fine‚Ä¶ the sound comes clear.  The battery health was at 86% which to me for a phone that is renewed is pretty good.  I tested the facial recognition and it works perfectly.  The only thing about this XR model I don‚Äôt really like is the home button‚Ä¶ maybe cuz it‚Äôs new to me‚Ä¶ but it gets in the way and wish it wasn‚Äôt part of the screen screen.  Also taking a screenshot was changed ‚Ä¶from my older dinosaur iPhone 7plus I would hit the home button with the button on the right but since xr doesn‚Äôt have it, u have to push the volume up button instead.  Overall very pleased and will update if things change over the next few months",5.0 out of 5 stars

Great phone!,"This was my teens first real phone. I chose this phone because of the battery life, storage, and extra large screen size.  My kid is a gamer but I was not going to be able to afford a good phone (necessary for safety) and a gaming device.  This has proven to be perfect for phone, gaming, and daily school needs.  My teen has been thrilled with the phone and has no complaints. It‚Äôs nice that Amazon has these options for people who don‚Äôt/can‚Äôt buy the ‚Äúnewest thing.‚Äù  I love the one year warranty as well.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Ok,"It works a lot better than my old phone, so I can‚Äôt really complain. However, I will note that it has some glitches. The screen doesn‚Äôt always respond to my touch, it seems to overheat quite easily, and it‚Äôs had some issues with my CarPlay. Every once in a while while using CarPlay, it switches to the speakers that are supposed to be used when you are on a phone call. I don‚Äôt know why it does this while playing music, but once I pause it and replay it, it stops. Also, it does this completely randomly, so I really don‚Äôt know what triggers it.  I also noticed that the Siri function doesn‚Äôt always go off or hear what I say properly. I haven‚Äôt had any other issues with the phone other than the slight glitches, but depending on my mood it can be quite frustrating. Seems to be an OK quality.",

Issues with Face ID and Screen.,"The positives:The phone overall was great. I purchased the 256gb and it came with a 92% battery life which honestly I was even shocked by since that's 12% more than guaranteed. It ran smoothly and whatnot, everything was working, or at least I thought it was.The negatives:The Face ID is completely broken, it won't work at all. I tried multiple times but kept getting hit with the ""Face ID is not available right now, try again later"". I tried everything I could including contacting Apple Support. Apple support confirmed that the screen of the iPhone was not a genuine apple screen and was third party, which likely broke the Face ID. Also unrelated to the Face ID but about the screen still, it shut off randomly out of no where and would not turn back on. I still heard audio coming from the phone, but the screen was black... I had to do a hard reset of the phone using Find My iPhone from another device to fix it. Not that bad, but still scary.Nonetheless if you don't mind not having Face ID possibly, then this phone is nice.",

Speaker static and Sleep button jammed,"Horrible experience with the renewal program and its sellers. I paid extra for the premium renewal, and the phone came out worst than the regular renewal.First problem: the stereo receiver speaker is experiencing much static noise on medium to high volume. The moment you make a phone call, you can hear the static and cant hear the person clearly.Second problem: The side button is not clicking and getting jammed.I understand this is a refurbished iPhone, and that might not be perfect, but amazon promise that these phones inspect for convenience.This is supposed to be a grade-A renewal phone that Amazon thoroughly checked. I don't recommend amazon renewal programs for mobiles phone.",
